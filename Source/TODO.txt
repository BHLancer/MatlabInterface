Goal: Create MATLAB SDK interface analogous to OpenEphys processing architecture such that it could ultimately transpile a Matlab code into Open Ephys C++ code.

1. Assume Open-Ephys is a 'Source' plugin.
2. Create a class that represents a GenericProcessor that can be either a filter or sink. 
3. Use Java background thread to write data to disk if necessary.

classdef Plotter < GenericProcessor

	properties
	end

	methods
		function self = Plotter()
			self = self@GenericProcessor();
		end

		function process(self)
		end

	end
end
